            CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more.

        <p><b>Padding</b> is the space between an element's border and the element's content. <b>Margin</b> is used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders. <b>Border</b> is a shorthand syntax in CSS that accepts multiple values for drawing a line around the element it is applied to. <br>While <i>padding</i> creates extra space within an element, <i>Margin</i> creates extra space around an element, <i>Border</i> goes around the padding and content.</p>
